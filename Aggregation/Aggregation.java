/* 

The first relationship that you will see is Aggregation which is also known as Has-a relationship. This kind of relationship exists between two classes when a reference variable of one class is a member variable in another class. Consider the below examples. 

Example 1: - Consider a class Department. Department will have various member variables like department name, department Id. Apart from these member variables, a department also has a manager. This manager is actually an Employee and will have different set of member variables. The member variable manager in the Department class will be a reference of Employee class. In this case, we can say, Department has a manager (Employee) which is an Aggregation relationship.
